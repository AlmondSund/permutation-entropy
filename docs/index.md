# Permutation Entropy for Volcano Forecasting

This site documents the permutation-entropy prototype for eruption forecasting. The toolkit combines information-theoretic complexity measures (PE, MPE, WPE) with basic machine-learning models to estimate eruption probabilities from continuous seismic data.
